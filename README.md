# Azure Bots The Hard Way

This template deploys:

* An Azure Web App (Basic plan) with:
  * A supporting storage account (for WebJob storage and your own queues)
  * An Application Insights account
* A simple bot that echoes back replies

## Usage

Unlike typical Azure templates, this one is completely CLI centric, so there are no "click to deploy" links (sorry Windows folk!)

Grab `bash`, check out the `Makefile` and you'll be all set.

## Requirements

* [Azure CLI 2.0][az]
* [NodeJS][n]

## Roadmap:

* [x] Deploy Azure App Service
* [x] Deploy Storage Account for queues (already part of webjob requirements)
* [x] Configure App Service deployment settings
* [x] Retrieve/Set App Service local Git credentials and deployment remote programmatically
* [x] Simple static server inside Functions app
* [x] Simple bot back-end
* [ ] Simple web front-end for anonymous chats
* [ ] Bot registration
* [ ] Provision default queues and tables
* [ ] User identity management
* [ ] State machine
* [ ] Deploy Cognitive Services Account
* [ ] Enable deployment slots

## Bootstrapping a new development machine

If you don't have _anything_ installed, this is what you need to do (generic instructions for Debian-based systems - may require `sudo` or tweaking your `$PATH`):

        apt install nodejs npm python-pip
        pip install -U azure-cli

## Deploying from scratch
    
        az login
        az account list # check available accounts
        az account set -s <UUID> # set working account
        # edit the Makefile defaults for a new site
        make params
        make deploy
        make setup-scm

## Bot Registration

The following steps require a Microsoft Live ID account (which is typically _not_ how you log in to the Azure Portal in a corporate environment).

* Using your Azure credentials, log in to the Azure Portal and navigate to the function app
* Get the function URL for the `/bot` Azure Function (including key) 
* Login to https://dev.botframework.com with your Live ID, register a new bot
* Paste the function URL in the `Messaging Endpoint` field
* Click on the `Create Microsoft App ID and password` button to go to `apps.dev.microsoft.com`, log in with your Live ID and generate a new App ID and password
* Save those somewhere safe (like an `.env` file in the project root, which is _not_ visible to `git`)
* (Optionally) retrieve the Application Insights instrumentation key from the `Application Settings` tab in the Azure Functions instance
* Go to the Azure Portal and set the `MICROSOFT_APP_ID` and `MICROSOFT_APP_PASSWORD` environment variables in the `Application Settings` tab
